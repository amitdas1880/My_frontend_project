        <h2>Importance of Forest</h2>
        <p>
            Forests are home to more than half of the world’s land-based species of animals, 
            plants and insects. They combat climate change because of their capacity to remove
             carbon from the atmosphere and store it, which is called forest mitigation.

            This avoiding and reducing emissions of heat-trapping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere,
            which prevents the planet from warming to more extreme temperatures, is also called Climate
            change mitigation.
